### set working directory

rm(list=ls()) 
setwd("C://01 Mylocal driver/Coursera_Data_Science_Specialization/_Course5_Reproduciable Research")

library(dplyr)

### read activity data set
data<-read.csv("activity.csv")


## convert date strings to date objects

data$date <- as.Date(data$date)


str(data)

## Q1 What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#a.  Calculate the total steps taken per day

StepsPerDay  <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, FUN=sum)  ## Aggrigate steps for each date 

# b. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day
hist(StepsPerDay$steps,   main = "Total Steps per Day",
     xlab = "Number of steps")
     

# c.  Calculate and report the mean and median of total steps taken per day
     
StepsPerDayMean  <- mean(StepsPerDay$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

StepsPerDayMedian  <- median(StepsPerDay$steps, na.rm = TRUE)


## Q2 What is the average daily activity pattern?

# a. Make a time-series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of
     # steps taken, averaged acoss all days.
     
 ### aggrigate steps per interval and calcualte mean
StepsPerInterval  <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)  

## Rename column on average steps per interval dataset for merging
names(StepsPerInterval)[names(StepsPerInterval) == 'steps'] <- 'AverageSteps'

## Time series plot of 5-minute interval and average steps taken

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = StepsPerInterval, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +

  geom_line() +
  
  ggtitle("Average number of steps per interval") +  xlab("Five-minute Interval") +
  
  ylab("Average Number of Steps") +
  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.6))
  
# 3. Which 5-minute interval across all days contain the maximum number of steps

## Determine and report 5-minute interval containing max number of steps
MaxSteps <- StepsPerInterval$interval[which.max(StepsPerInterval$AverageSteps)]


## Imputing Missing Values

# a)  Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

missing_values_tot <- sum(is.na(data))

# b. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.



# c. Merge Activity and Average Steps Per Interval datasets for imputation
ImputedActivity = merge(data, StepsPerInterval, by="interval")

names(ImputedActivity)

##Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

## d. Impute missing steps in Activity with average steps per interval
ImputedActivity$steps[is.na(ImputedActivity$steps)]=ImputedActivity$AverageSteps[is.na(ImputedActivity$steps)]



# e.  Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and report the mean and median.

# Aggregate steps per interval and calculate the mean for each interval on imputed data
AggregatedImputedActivity <- aggregate(steps~interval,ImputedActivity,sum)

## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day (with imputed data)
hist(AggregatedImputedActivity$steps,xlab="Total steps",main="Total number of daily steps (Imputed)")

#f. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

# Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day (with imputed data)
ImputedStepsPerDayMean <- mean(AggregatedImputedActivity$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
ImputedStepsPerDayMedian <- median(AggregatedImputedActivity$steps, na.rm=TRUE)


## Calculate difference between unimputed and imputed mean/median number of steps per day
DiffMean <- ImputedStepsPerDayMean - StepsPerDayMean
DiffMedian <- ImputedStepsPerDayMedian - StepsPerDayMedian


### Q3 Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
## Create function to classify the type of day  as a factor
week_day <- function(date) {
    if (weekdays(date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) {
        "weekends"
    } else {
        "weekdays"
    }
}

## Apply DayCategory function to the date field in the ImputedActivity dataset
ImputedActivity$week_day <- as.factor(sapply(ImputedActivity$date, week_day))

##Describe dataset
str(ImputedActivity)


## Make a panel plot containing a time series plot
# Summarize data by interval and type of day

library(plyr) ## Load the plyr package


ImputedStepsPerIntervalDayCat <- ddply(ImputedActivity,.(interval,week_day),summarize,AverageSteps=mean(steps))

## Time series plot of 5-minute interval and average steps taken (Imputed) by type of day

library(lattice) # load the lattice package

xyplot(AverageSteps~interval|week_day,data=ImputedStepsPerIntervalDayCat,type="l",layout = c(1,2),

       main="Average steps (imputed) per interval and type of day",
       
       ylab="Average number of steps",xlab="Interval [5-min increments]")
